=========

Some hacking fun I had in Toronto. Page no longer exists, don't worry :)

I was on exchange at the University of Toronto September-December 2013 and I stayed in the Chestnut Residence. They had a crappy system of ordering food to-go for days ahead and in using it a few times I noticed that it was easy to hack.

The website NO LONGER EXISTS, but I can give you an overview of what I did.

1. No login required, not behind any security, simply choose a date from a calendar six columns wide - MISTAKE 1
2. Enter student number, upon which your full name, room number, student id and library number were returned.
3. Book meal and go

Using the bash script 'hack' and having an educated guess with my student number, I ran the script and low and behold, I managed to get ten results (which I will not show for privacy reasons, OBVIOUSLY)

The new site, luckily hidden behind the university security: https://mealstogo.chestnutresidence.utoronto.ca/

Someone finally woke up!!
